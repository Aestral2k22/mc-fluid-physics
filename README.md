# Fluid Physics (Minecraft Mod)
This mod blends together vanilla fluid mechanics with something a little more realistic plus some small additions.
Fluids flowing horizontally will not be affected by this mod. Fluids flowing down will take the source with them.

## Features
- Fluid source blocks can flow down
- Removes infinite water sources (not a good idea with this mod)
- Pistons can pump fluids
- Spring blocks generate under naturally generated springs and prevent them from flowing down
- Rain refills lakes and oceans (similar to infinite water sources in vanilla)

## Known issues
- Under some circumstances fluids can stop flowing (This is why in the video I have the glass block slowing down the water flowing into the sandstone tank)

# Fluid Physics (Minecraft Mod)
This mod makes fluids flow realistically but tries to preserve as much of the vanilla fluid physics as possible.

## Features
- Fluid source blocks can flow down
- Pistons can pump fluids
- Spring blocks generate under naturally generated springs and prevent them from flowing down
